Here's where you'll write your code. 
  - Follow the instructions in the README file.
  - If you try to write all the code in `play_hangman`, 
    it's going to be a mess. Instead, break your logic
    into smaller functions that you can call from 
    `play_hangman`.

Run your code from the terminal:
  - make sure you're in the right directory (`projects/hangman`)
    - if you're not sure how to get to the right directory, ask!
  - make sure you're at the command line prompt, not in the Python shell (not >>>)
  - type the following command: python hangman.py

Tests? No tests for this project.
