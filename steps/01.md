# Step 1: Prompt for a secret word

Ask the first user to enter a secret word for the other player to guess. Store
that word in a sensibly-named variable. We'll surely need to refer back to it.

If you're not sure how to ask for input and store it in a variable, look back to
some of the code you've already written. In particular, look for places where
you used the `input` function.
