# Step 2: Set up your record keeping

What information do you need to keep track of?

At minimum, you'll need to keep track of which letters have been guessed. Does it
make sense to track correct and incorrect guesses in the same place and in the
same way? What data structure(s) would work best?

Think about what you'll need to do with this information? Here's a few
considerations to get you started:

- How will you check if a letter has already been guessed?
- How will you tell the player where a correct guess is located in the word?
- How will you know when the game is over? Can the same information tell you
  if the player has won or lost?

Create and initialize variables to keep track of the state of the game.

As you run into problems or needs you didn't anticipate, there's a good chance
you'll change your mind about what to track and how best to track it. Such is
life for a programmer.
