# Step 3: Start building the initial game board

When the game starts and after each guess, we need to display the current state
of the game. We'll add more elements to our game board later, but let's start by
thinking about how to display the secret word with any correctly guessed letters
filled in and a list of guessed letters.

When the game begins, there are no guessed letters and thus no correct guesses.
In that case, we want to display an underscore for each letter in the secret word.
For example, if the secret word is `knight` (6 letters long), write code that will
print 6 space-separated underscores, like this:

```
_ _ _ _ _ _
Letters guessed:
```

How you'll it depends on how you've chosen to store game state.
