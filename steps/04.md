# Step 4: Ask the user to guess a letter and update the game state

With a secret word stored and a basic game board printed to the screen, we're
ready to play. The steps we're about to code will eventually need to be
repeated, but for now, let's get and process only a single guess.

Ask you the second player to guess a letter.

We've reached a fork in the road. The guessed letter is either in the word or
it's not. Exactly what you'll do depends on how your tracking game state. Use
the updated game state to print an updated game board:

- `if` the guess is correct, replace the appropriate blank with the guessed
  letter. For example, if the guess was `i` and the secret word is `knight`, the
  game board should now look like this: `_ _ i _ _ _`.
- `else` print the basic game board (still all underscores), and print the
  (incorrectly?) guessed letter (for now, just a single letter).
